            The STIRData platform comprises a collection of tools and methodologies designed to establish
            interoperability among business-related datasets. Its purpose is to aid data owners, publishers, and users
            in sharing machine-readable and semantically meaningful data.
          </p>
          <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
            At its core, the platform adheres to the STIRData specification, which outlines standards for the
            representation, exchange, and transformation of business data. The STIRData project introduces two key
            outcomes open for evaluation:
          </p>
          <ul class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
            <li>
              A linked data architecture enabling business registries to maintain data locally.
            </li>
            <li>
              The STIRData portal, which empowers users to access open company data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
            To assess the project's efficacy, two evaluation questionnaires were devised â€“ one for the
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScb0iBR5g9cdC2ngMzENKP-_3NIv4mTGSu9_ve88HP4OQ0kqg/viewform" target="_blank">portal</a>
            and another for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaIl_eks4M_CLkCyFmmMZCDuJsi0QfEaQM7YUW0Q6RhPDM7g/formResponse" target="_blank">architecture</a>.
            A diverse set of 30 evaluators, including Experts, ECG Group, members of the European
            Commission's SEMIC team, and regular users, participated. Findings highlighted the STIRData platform's
            significance in promoting data interoperability.

            <strong>Strengths</strong>
          </h2>
          <ul class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
            <li>
              Based on a widely accepted and well-defined specification: The STIRData specification is based on the W3C
              Semantic Web standards, which are widely accepted by the data community. This makes it easier for data
              owners, publishers, and re-users to understand and use the platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offers a comprehensive toolset aligned with the specification: The STIRData platform provides a comprehensive
              set of tools that can be used to implement the STIRData specification. These tools include a data modeling
              tool, a data transformation tool, and a data publishing tool.
            </li>
            <li>
              Boasts user-friendliness: The STIRData platform is designed to be user-friendly. The tools are easy to use
              and the documentation is clear and concise. This makes it easy for users of all levels of experience to
              get started with the platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adheres to open-source principles: The STIRData platform is open source, which means that it is freely
              available to use and modify. This allows users to customize the platform to meet their specific needs.

            <strong>Weaknesses</strong>
          </h2>
          <ul class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
            <li>
              The current distributed architecture exhibits immaturity, leading to performance concerns: The STIRData
              platform uses a distributed architecture, which means that the data is stored on multiple servers. This can
              lead to performance problems, especially when the data is large or complex. The platform is still under
              development, and the distributed architecture is not yet fully mature. This can lead to performance problems,
              such as slow query response times.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some users may find its utilization complex: The STIRData platform can be complex to use, especially for
              users who are not familiar with the STIRData specification. The platform uses a number of technical terms
              and concepts, which can be difficult to understand for some users.
            </li>
            <li>
              Effective usage mandates a certain level of technical proficiency: The STIRData platform requires a certain
              level of technical proficiency to use effectively. This can be a barrier to adoption for some users who do
              not have the necessary skills. The platform uses a number of technical tools and concepts, which can be
              difficult to learn for some users.
